<h2 id="i3c_controller_inbandinterrupt_it-example-description"><b>I3C_Controller_InBandInterrupt_IT Example Description</b></h2>
<p>How to handle an In-Band-Interrupt event between an I3C Controller and I3C Targets</p>
<pre><code>  - Board: NUCLEO-H503RB&#39;s (embeds a STM32H503RB device)
  - SCL Pin: PB6 (Arduino SCL/D15 CN5 pin 10, Morpho CN10 pin3) to PB6 (Arduino SCL/D15 CN5 pin 10, Morpho CN10 pin3)
  - SDA Pin: PB7 (Arduino SDA/D14 CN5 pin 9, Morpho CN10 pin5) to PB7 (Arduino SDA/D14 CN5 pin 9, Morpho CN10 pin5)
  Connect GND between each board
  Use short wire as possible between the boards or twist an independent ground wire on each I3C lines
  mean one GND twist around SCL and one GND twist around SDA to help communication at 12.5Mhz.</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 250 MHz.</p>
<p>The I3C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I3C_Init() function. This later is calling the HAL_I3C_MspInit()function which core is implementing the configuration of the needed I3C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO and NVIC). User may update this function to change I3C configuration. To have a better signal startup, the user must adapt the parameter BusFreeDuration depends on its hardware constraint. The value of BusFreeDuration set on this example is link to Nucleo hardware environment.</p>
<p>The I3C communication is then initiated.</p>
<p>The project is split in two workspaces: the Controller Board (I3C_Controller_InBandInterrupt_IT) and the Target Boards (I3C_Target_InBandInterrupt_IT)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Controller Board The HAL_I3C_SetConfigFifo() and the HAL_I3C_Ctrl_Config() allow respectively the configuration of the internal hardware FIFOs and the configuration of the Controller Stall and own specific parameter.</p>
<p>The HAL_I3C_Ctrl_DynAddrAssign_IT() function allow the Controller to manage a Dynamic Address Assignment procedure to Target connected on the bus. This communication is done at 12.5Mhz based on I3C source clock which is at 250 MHz</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The HAL_I3C_ActivateNotification() and the HAL_I3C_GetCCCInfo() function allow respectively the enabling of Asynchronous catching event in Controller mode using Interrupt and to retrieve the Targets In-Band-Interrupt payload and the Target associated Dynamic Address.</p>
<p>For this example, the TargetDesc1, TargetDesc2 are predefined related to Target descriptor.</p>
<p>Controller side: In a first step, after the user press the USER push-button on the Controller Board, the Controller initiate the sending of the ENTDAA CCC Command through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_DynAddrAssign_IT() to I3C Targets which receive the Command and treat it by sending its own payload.</p>
<p>Then when ENTDAA is terminated thanks to reception of the completion callback HAL_I3C_CtrlDAACpltCallback(), the controller store the Target capabilities in the peripheral hardware register side through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_ConfigBusDevices().</p>
<p>Then Controller wait in a no activity loop.</p>
<p>Then, at reception of an In-Band-Interrupt event request from a Target, the I3C Controller retrieve Target Dynamic Address with associated data if any through HAL_I3C_GetCCCInfo().</p>
<p>User can verify through debug the payload value by watch the content of CCCInfo in the field IBICRTgtAddr and IBITgtPayload.</p>
<p>Those information will help the Controller to starts a private communication through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_Receive_IT() or a Direct communication through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_ReceiveCCC_IT() to I3C Target which sent the In-Band-Interrupt.</p>
<p>The Controller In-Band-Interrupt procedure is terminated when the IBI event treatment is completed by calling the callback HAL_I3C_NotifyCallback().</p>
<p>The whole IBI process is placed in an infinite loop for the Controller to be able to receive and treat any new IBI request from the Target.</p>
<p>Target side: In a first step after retrieve a Dynamic address, the user press the USER push-button on a Target Board, I3C Target starts the communication by sending the In-Band-Interrupt request to the Controller.</p>
<p>This first action on Target side can be done at the same time or independently on one or other Targets. In fact, after this starting In-Band-Interrupt procedure, the I3C Controller catch the event and the associated information like IBI additional data.</p>
<p>NUCLEO-H503RBâ€™s LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status: - LED2 is toggle each time an In-Band-Interrupt process is completed. - LED2 is toggle slowly when there is an error in In-Band-Interrupt process. .</p>
<h4 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.</p></li>
<li><p>The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.</p></li>

<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><b>How to use it ?</b></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuild all files and load your image into Controller memory (I3C_Controller_InBandInterrupt_IT)</li>
<li>Then rebuild all files and load your image into Target memory (I3C_Target_InBandInterrupt_IT)</li>
<li>Run the Controller before run the Target. This sequence will prevent a false startup phase on Target side as there is no high level on the bus, if the Target is started before the Controller.</li>
</ul>
