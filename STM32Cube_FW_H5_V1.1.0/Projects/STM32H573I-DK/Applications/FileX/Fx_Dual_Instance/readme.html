<h2><b>Fx_Dual_Instance Application Description</b></h2>
<p>This application provide user a working example of two storage media
managed by two independent instances of FileX/LevelX running on
STM32H573I-DK board. This is to demonstrate the coexistence capability
of two FileX/Levelx stacks running independently.</p>
<p>Two independent media storage: µSD and OSPI NOR Flash will be used on
STM32H573I-DK board.</p>
<p>Each Thread will create her own file system using one instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>fx_thread_one: will create file system on µSD using FileX
stack.</li>
<li>fx_thread_two: will create file system on OSPI NOR Flash using
FileX/LevelX stacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>fx_thread_one:</p>
<ul>
<li>fx_thread_one (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to initialize
the SD driver and starting FileX’s file operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fx_thread_one uses FileX services to open the SD media for file
operations and attempt to create file STM32_FILE1.TXT. If the file
exists already,</p>
<p>it will be overwritten. Dummy content is then written into the file
and it is closed. The file is opened once again in read mode and
content</p>
<p>is checked if matches what was previously written.</p>
<p>fx_thread_two:</p>
<ul>
<li>fx_thread_two (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used for file
operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fx_thread_two will start by formatting the NOR Flash using FileX
services. The resulting file system is a FAT32 compatible, with 512
bytes per sector and 8 sectors per cluster. The NOR flash should be
reset prior to format either by the application or by the
STM32CubeProgrammer, this allows LevelX and FileX to create a clean FAT
FileSystem. Chip erase operation takes considerable time when done by
the application, therefore it is disabled by default. To enable it,
please define the flag <code>LX_STM32_OSPI_ERASE</code> to <b> 1 </b> in
“lx_stm32_ospi_driver.h”:</p>
<pre><code>#define LX_STM32_OSPI_ERASE                              1</code></pre>
<p>Upon successful opening of the flash media, FileX continue with
creating a file called “STM32.TXT” into the root directory, then write
into it some dummy data. Then file is re-opened in read only mode and
content is checked.</p>
<p>Through all the steps, FileX/LevelX services are called to print
(using USRAT1) the flash size available before and after the example
file is written into the flash. The number of occupied sectors is also
shown.</p>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>µSD card:
<ul>
<li>A file named STM32_FILE1.TXT should be visible in the root directory
of the SD card.</li>
<li>A blinking green led light marks the success of the file
operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nor Flash:
<ul>
<li>Successful operation is marked by a toggling green led.</li>
<li>Information regarding the total and available size of the flash
media is printed to the serial port(USART1).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b> Error behaviors</b></h4>
<pre><code>  - On failure, the red led should start blinking and green led is off.
  - Error handler is called at the spot where the error occurred.</code></pre>
<h4 id="assumptions-if-any"><b>Assumptions if any</b></h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4 id="known-limitations"><b>Known limitations</b></h4>
<p>No SD card insertion/removal mechanisms are implemented.</p>
<h3 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before starting the application, the SD card should be present in
the SD card connector and formatted initially by user.</li>
<li>Make sure that the camera module is not plugged (CN16) on the board
(MB1550)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the
HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be
taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is
always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the
“TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in
“tx_initialize_low_level.S” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid
any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL) should
be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread
entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is
automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly
recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related
resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any
way contain a system API call (HAL).</li>
<li>Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to
the linker file. ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free
memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function, using
the “first_unused_memory” argument. This require changes in the linker
files to expose this memory location.
<ul>
<li>For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For MDK-ARM:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the &quot;.sct&quot; file
or modify the line below in &quot;tx_low_level_initilize.s to match the memory region being used
    LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>._threadx_heap :
  {
     . = ALIGN(8);
     __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
     . = . + 64K;
     . = ALIGN(8);
   } &gt;RAM_D1 AT&gt; RAM_D1</code></pre>
<pre><code>The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.
Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).
Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: &quot;Linker script&quot;.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The “tx_initialize_low_level.S” should be also modified to enable
the “USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION” flag.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filexlevelx-usage-hints"><b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to
understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a
valid filesystem.</li>
<li>When calling the fx_media_format() API, NOR sector size is always
512 bytes.</li>
