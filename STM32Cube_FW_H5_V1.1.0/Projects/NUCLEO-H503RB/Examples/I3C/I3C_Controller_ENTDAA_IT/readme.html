<h2 id="i3c_controller_entdaa_it-example-description"><b>I3C_Controller_ENTDAA_IT Example Description</b></h2>
<p>How to handle an ENTDAA procedure between an I3C Controller and two I3C Targets.</p>
<pre><code>  - Board: NUCLEO-H503RB (embeds a STM32H503RB device)
  - SCL Pin: PB6 (Arduino SCL/D15 CN5 pin 10, Morpho CN10 pin3)
  - SDA Pin: PB7 (Arduino SDA/D14 CN5 pin 9, Morpho CN10 pin5)
  Connect GND between each board
  Use short wire as possible between the boards or twist an independent ground wire on each I3C lines
  mean one GND twist around SCL and one GND twist around SDA to help communication at 12.5Mhz.</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 250 MHz.</p>
<p>The I3C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I3C_Init() function. This later is calling the HAL_I3C_MspInit() function which core is implementing the configuration of the needed I3C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO and NVIC). User may update this function to change I3C configuration. To have a better signal startup, the user must adapt the parameter BusFreeDuration depends on its hardware constraint. The value of BusFreeDuration set on this example is link to Nucleo hardware environment.</p>
<p>The I3C communication is then initiated. The project is split in two workspace: the Controller Board (I3C_Controller_ENTDAA_IT) and the Target Boards (I3C_Target_ENTDAA_IT)</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller Board The HAL_I3C_SetConfigFifo(), the HAL_I3C_Ctrl_Config(), the HAL_I3C_Ctrl_DynAddrAssign_IT() and the HAL_I3C_Ctrl_SetDynamicAddress functions allow respectively the configuration of the internal hardware FIFOs, the configuration of the Controller Stall and own specific parameter, the reception of the Targets payload connected on the Bus and assign a proper Dynamic address for each of them using Interrupt mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example the TargetDesc1, TargetDesc2 are predefined related to Target descriptor.</p>
<p>Controller side:</p>
<p>In a first step after the user press the USER push-button on the Controller Board, I3C Controller starts the communication by sending the ENTDAA CCC Command through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_DynAddrAssign_IT() to I3C Targets which receive the Command and treat it by sending its own payload. The communication run at 12,5Mhz during Push-pull phases based on I3C source clock which is at 250 MHz.</p>
<p>Each time a Target send its complete payload, Controller is informed at reception of it through HAL_I3C_TgtReqDynamicAddrCallback(). At this step, Controller compute/assign a Dynamic address to the Target, and sent it to Target through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_SetDynamicAddress().</p>
<p>Then on hardware side, another frame Dynamic Address Assignment is automatically sent on the I3C Bus to request other payload of any other Target connected on the Bus. And Software repeat the assignation of another Dynamic address to the other Target through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_SetDynamicAddress() after reception of HAL_I3C_TgtReqDynamicAddrCallback().</p>
<p>The Controller assignment procedure is terminated when no additional Target respond to Dynamic Address Assignment procedure and at reception of HAL_I3C_CtrlDAACpltCallback().</p>
<p>Target side:</p>
<p>In a first step, until Dynamic Address Assignment procedure from the Controller, the Target wait in a no activity loop. Then, at reception of the Dynamic Address Assignment procedure from the Controller, each Target start the sending of its payload until it lost the communication, where a Target when lost the transaction it must quit the communication.</p>
<p>A lost of communication, or better naming arbitration lost, arrived on Target which have lowest number of bits 0 in their payload. More bits 0 on the payload win the transaction, as this exchange operate in Open-drain phases.</p>
<p>The end of this Dynamic Address Assignment is monitored by the reception of HAL_I3C_CtrlDAACpltCallback() on Controller side.</p>
<p>NUCLEO-H503RBâ€™s LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:</p>
<ul>
<li>LED2 is ON when the Dynamic Address Assignment process is complete.</li>
<li>LED2 toggle slowly when there is an error in Dynamic Address Assignment process.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.</p></li>
<li><p>The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.</p></li>

<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><b>How to use it ?</b></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuild all files and load your image into Controller memory (I3C_Controller_ENTDAA_IT)</li>
<li>Then rebuild all files and load your image into Target memory (I3C_Target_ENTDAA_IT)</li>
<li>Run the Controller before run the Target, this will let a false startup phase on Target side as there is no high level on the bus, if the Target is started before the Controller.</li>
</ul>
