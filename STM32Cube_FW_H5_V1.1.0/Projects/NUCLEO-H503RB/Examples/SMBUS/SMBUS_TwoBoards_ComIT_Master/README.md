## <b>SMBUS_TwoBoards_ComIT_Master Example Description</b>

How to handle SMBUS data buffer transmission/reception between two boards,
in interrupt mode.

  - Board: NUCLEO-H503RB (embeds a STM32H503RB device)
  - SCL Pin: PB.10 (CN9, D6)
  - SDA Pin: PB.13 (CN10, Pin 30)

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H503 Devices :
The CPU at 250 MHz.

The SMBUS peripheral configuration is ensured by HAL_SMBUS_Init() function which calls HAL_SMBUS_MspInit() function.
This HAL_SMBUS_MspInit() function allows the user to configure the needed SMBUS resources according to the used
hardware (CLOCK,GPIO).

The SMBUS communication is then initiated.
The project is split in two parts: the Master Board and the Slave Board

- Master Board :
  The HAL_SMBUS_Master_Receive_IT() and the HAL_SMBUS_Master_Transmit_IT() functions
  allow respectively the reception and the transmission of a predefined data buffer
  and packet error checking (PEC) byte in Master mode using interrupt.

- Slave Board :
  The HAL_SMBUS_Slave_Receive_IT() and the HAL_SMBUS_Slave_Transmit_IT() functions
  allow respectively the reception and the transmission of a predefined data buffer
  and packet error checking (PEC) byte in Slave mode using interrupt.
If the Master board is used, the project SMBUS_TwoBoards_ComIT_Master must be used.
If the Slave board is used, the project SMBUS_TwoBoards_ComIT_Slave must be used.

For this example the aTxBuffer is predefined and the aRxBuffer size is same as aTxBuffer.

In a first step after the user press the User push-button on the Master Board,
SMBUS Master starts the communication by sending aTxBuffer through HAL_SMBUS_Master_Transmit_IT()
to SMBUS Slave which receives aRxBuffer through HAL_SMBUS_Slave_Receive_IT().
The second step starts when the user press the User push-button on the Master Board,
the SMBUS Slave sends aTxBuffer through HAL_SMBUS_Slave_Transmit_IT()
to the SMBUS Master which receives aRxBuffer through HAL_SMBUS_Master_Receive_IT().
Finally, aTxBuffer and aRxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to
check buffers correctness.

NUCLEO-H503RB's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:

 - LED2 toggles quickly (100 ms) on master board waiting User push-button to be pressed.
 - LED2 turns OFF as soon as the push-button is pressed on master board.
 - LED2 is ON when the transmission process is complete.
 - LED2 toggles quickly (300 ms)  on master board waiting User push-button to be pressed.
 - LED2 is OFF when the reception process is complete on both boards.
 - LED2 toggles slowly(1000 ms) when there is an error in transmission/reception process.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H503RBTx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H503RB
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H503RB Set-up
    - Connect I2C_SCL line of Master board (PB.10, CN9, D6) to I2C_SCL line of Slave Board (PB.10, CN9, D6).
    - Connect I2C_SDA line of Master board (PB.13, CN10, Pin 30) to I2C_SDA line of Slave Board (PB.13, CN10, Pin 30).
    - Connect GND of Master board to GND of Slave Board.
