## <b>SPI_OneBoard_HalfDuplex_IT_Init Example Description</b>

Configuration of GPIO and SPI peripherals to transmit bytes
from an SPI Master device to an SPI Slave device in Interrupt mode. This example
is based on the STM32H5xx SPI LL API. The peripheral initialization uses
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

This example works with only one NUCLEO-H563ZI.

SPI1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode Half-Duplex Tx.
SPI2 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode Half-Duplex Rx.
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI.

Example execution:

LED1 is blinking Fast (200ms) and wait USER push-button action.
Press USER push-button on BOARD start a Half-Duplex communication through IT.
On MASTER side (SPI1), Clock will be generated on SCK line, Transmission done on MOSI Line.
On SLAVE side (SPI2) reception is done through the MISO Line.

LED1 is On if data is well received.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking Slowly (1s).

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H563ZITx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H563ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-H563ZI Set-up
    - Connect Master SCK  PA5 to Slave SCK  PB13
    - Connect Master MOSI PA7 to Slave MISO PB14

Relation with Board connector:
  PA5  is connected to pin 11 of CN5 connector
  PA7  is connected to pin 15 of CN5 connector
  PB13 is connected to pin 30 of CN5 connector
  PB14 is connected to pin 28 of CN5 connector
