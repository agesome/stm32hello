## <b>OEMiROT_Boot application description</b>

This project provides an OEMiROT example. OEMiROT boot path performs authenticity and the integrity checks of the project firmware and data
images.

The core function of this application relies on the mcuboot middleware and the mbed-crypto middleware.

This project shows how to implement an OEMiROT.

To ease the development process, a prebuild command and postbuild command are integrated in the project.
The prebuild command is in charge of preparing the OEMiROT_Boot scatter file according to flash layout description.
The postbuild command is in charge of preparing the provisioning scripts and the application image
(firmware application managed by OEMiROT) configuration files in ROT_Provisioning/OEMiROT folder,
according to the flash layout and OEMiROT configuration.


The maximum system clock frequency at 250Mhz is configured.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H503xx devices.
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H503RB (MB1814)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
  - To get debug print in your UART console you have to configure it using these parameters:
    Speed: 115200, Data: 8bits, Parity: None, stop bits: 1, Flow control: none.


### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to build the OEMiROT_Boot project, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild the project

Then refer to OEMiROT_Appli readme for example of application booted through OEMiROT boot path.
