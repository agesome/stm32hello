## <b>RCC_LSIConfig Example Description</b>

How to enable/disable the low-speed internal (LSI) RC oscillator (about 32 KHz) at run time, using the RCC HAL API.

   - Board: NUCLEO-H563ZI (embeds a STM32H563ZI device)
   - Microcontroller Clock Output MCO2 Pin: PC.09

In this example, after startup SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI as clock source, the USER push-button (connected to External line 13)
is used to enable/disable LSI:
each time the USER push-button is pressed, External line 13 interrupt is generated and the ISR
enables the LSI when it is off, disables it when it is on.

LED1 behaviour is as follows according to LSI activation:

 - when LSI is on, **LED1** is toggling (every 100 ms).
 - when LSI is off, **LED1** is on.
LSI clock waveform is available on the MCO1 pin PA.08 and can be captured
on an oscilloscope.

In case of configuration error, **LED3** is on.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H563ZITx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H563ZI
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
