## <b>CORTEX_MPU example Description</b>
Presentation of the MPU features. This example configures MPU attributes of different
MPU regions then configures a memory area as privileged read-only, and attempts to
perform read and write operations in different modes.

If the access is permitted LED2 is toggling. If the access is not permitted,
a memory management fault is generated and LED2 is ON.

To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, press
user button.

### <b>Notes</b>

  - Using STM32CubeIDE debugger, when hard fault is generated user shall press the debugger "Run" button to continue the execution

### <b>Keywords</b>

MPU, interrupt, MPU memory fault exception,
