<ol type="1">
<li>INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.</li>

</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCTION USE.

In the event hardware is not listed in the LICENSED-HARDWARE.txt file, you do not have the rights in this Section 2.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Distribution and Production Use Rights.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>You may use the software in production (e.g. program the modified or unmodified software to devices you own or control) and distribute (i.e. make available to third parties) the modified or unmodified binary image produced from this code.</p></li>

</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>when distributed in binary form, except as embedded in a device, include with such distribution the terms of this agreement;</p></li>
<li><p>when distributed in source code form to distributors or developers of your devices, include with such distribution the terms of this agreement; and</p></li>
<li><p>indemnify, defend and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your devices, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified software.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Restrictions. You may not:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>use or modify the software to create a competing real time operating system software;</p></li>
<li><p>remove any copyright notices or licenses contained in the software;</p></li>

<li><p>use or distribute the software in any way that would subject the software or Microsoft’s intellectual property or technology to any other license terms.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;</p></li>
<li><p>use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or</p></li>
<li><p>share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (except as permitted in Section 2 above), or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>DATA. This software may interact with other Microsoft products that collect data that is transmitted to Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft processes personal data we collect, please see the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248681.</p></li>
<li><p>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.</p></li>

<li><p>TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate this agreement if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the software and all of its component parts.</p></li>
<li><p>ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software. To the extent you have entered into a separate agreement with Microsoft relating specifically to the software, the terms in such agreement shall control.</p></li>
<li><p>APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.</p></li>
<li><p>CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.</p></li>
<li><p>Germany and Austria.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called “cardinal obligations”). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p></li>
<li><p>LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.</p>
<p>Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.</p>
<p>Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.</p>
<p>EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.</p>
<p>LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.</p>
<p>Cette limitation concerne:</p>
<p>•tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et</p>
<p>•les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.</p>
<p>Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.</p>
<p>EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.</p>
