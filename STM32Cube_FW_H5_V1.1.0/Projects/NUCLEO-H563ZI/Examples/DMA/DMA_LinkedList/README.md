## <b>DMA_LinkedList Example Description</b>

How to use the DMA to perform a list of transfers. The transfer list is organized as linked-list,
each time the current transfer ends the DMA automatically reload the next transfer parameters,
and starts it (without CPU intervention).

This project is targeted to run on STM32H563ZITx devices on NUCLEO-H563ZI board from STMicroelectronics.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK)
to run at 250 MHz.

The Linked List is configured using the "DMA_LinkedListConfig" function.

This function configures the DMA for a linked-list transfer which contains 3 nodes.

All nodes are filled using HAL function "HAL_DMAEx_LinkedList_BuildNode".

Nodes are connected to the linked-list using the HAL function "HAL_DMAEx_LinkedList_InsertNode_Tail".

After setting all nodes parameters using HAL_DMAEx_LinkedList_BuildNode()/HAL_DMAEx_LinkedList_InsertNode_Tail(),
start the transfer in interrupt mode using HAL_DMAEx_LinkedList_Start_IT() function.

Note that using the DMA, the transfer data length is always expressed in bytes whatever
the source and destination data size (byte, half word or word).

At the end, the main program waits for the end of DMA transmission or error interrupts: the DMA transmission ends
when all transfer nodes are served.

NUCLEO-H563ZI board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:

 - LED1 toggle when no error detected.
 - LED3 is ON when any error occurred.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
