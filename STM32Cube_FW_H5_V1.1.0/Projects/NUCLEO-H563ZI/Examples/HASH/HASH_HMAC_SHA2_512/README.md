## <b>HASH_HMAC_SHA2_512 example Description</b>
This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to 
hash data using long Key and SHA_512 Algorithm.

###### <b>Note</b>
For this example, DMA is not used for data transfer, the CPU is using HASH peripheral in
polling mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 250 MHz.

The key used is long type (2088 bits = 261 bytes).
The HMAC SHA-512 message digest result is a 512-bit long (64 bytes) data

The expected HMAC digests (expectedHmacSHA512) are already computed using an online
HASH tool. Those values are compared to those computed by the HASH (Sha512Hmacoutput).

In case there is a mismatch the red LED is turned ON (LED3).
In case the HMAC SHA512 digest is computed correctly the green LED (LED1) is turned ON.

###### <b>Notes</b>
 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
