## <b>OTFDEC_Data_Decrypt Example Description</b>

This example describes how to decrypt data (encrypted with CRYPT peripheral) located on the OCTOSPI external flash  using the OTFDEC peripheral

The leds of the STM32H573I-DK board are used to monitor the status as following:

- LED_GREEN is ON when the checked data is correct.
- LED_RED is On when an OTFDEC error occurs.
- LED_RED toggles as soon as an error is returned by HAL API.

This project is targeted to run on STM32H573xx devices on STM32H573I-DK board from STMicroelectronics.

The project configures the maximum system clock frequency at 250Mhz.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H573xx devices without security enabled (TZEN=0).

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H573I-DK (MB1677 revB)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
    
  - To run this example on STM32H573I-DK (MB1677 revA), /* #define STM32H573I_DK_REVA */ should be uncommented in main.h

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - Please avoid to view memory with the debugger before decrypting data (view memory), it may block the decryption.
